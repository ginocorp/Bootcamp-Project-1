# Project One: Deezer New Music Generator

## User Story

```
As a music lover, I want to find the top tracks, albums and playlists for my favorite artist.
I WANT to enter my favorite artist 
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
1. When I enter a valid music artist name in the search bar and click top tracks, it displays the top 20 tracks from that artist.
2. When I enter a valid music artist name in the search bar and click top tracks, it displays an image.
3. When I enter a search term, it will save to local storage and appear as a selection the next time you search.
```
